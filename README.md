# Expectations coming into this

I never planned on creating anything quite like this, but since I am currently in the interview process for a variety of Software Engineer type roles, I was actually asked to convert my current Resume into a vanilla HTML file.

My constraints for the project were to NOT use any frameworks or even CSS to an extent, I was only really allowed to use HTML.

So, I thought this was rather interesting and decided to have some fun with it!

I satisfied the companies request (I Hope!) however after submitting the .html file, I was curious as to how nice I could make it if I implemented CSS to my own style!

Which is what brought me here haha!

Perhaps next time I'll implement a framework, but I'm actually quite proud of how close this .html/css page is to my actual resume and honestly I think it looks even nicer than my actual resume.

I may come back here to edit things here and there, IDK, but for now I'm pretty happy with it!
